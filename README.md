# A-B-tests

A/B tests are performed to test changes on a web page by running experiment where a control group 
see the old version while the experiment group sees the new version. Based on a metric, 
we see how people react to the change. This metric helps measure th level of engagement from users in each group.

## Project details 
This project aims to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. he company has developed
a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who 
decide to pay for the company's product. 

## Task 
Help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment
longer to make their decision.

## Results

* After running a one-side test, we fail to reject that the old page lead to more conversions.
* Using a regression approach (a two-side test), we also fail to reject that the old page lead to more conversions.

Based on this statistical results, I think that the company should stick to the old website. However, it will be a good
idea to extend the duration of the test to be sure that the results obtained in the course of these tests are not due to
change aversion.
